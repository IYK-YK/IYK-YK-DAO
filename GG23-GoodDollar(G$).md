ðŸ“„ Gitcoin Grant Application Draft (GoodDollar x IYKYK)

âœ… Payout Wallet

Gnosis Safe: Yes

Wallet Address: eth:0x043B7211F730EFB1b94B30A4D421D739e21

âœ… Project Description

IYKYK DAO is a culture-first public goods collective building an onchain memecoin ecosystem to support public goods & regenerative finance. Our launch includes a Juicebox-powered token ($IYKYK) and a phased liquidity strategy that allocates ETH and governance to mission-aligned ecosystems like GoodDollar.

Through this grant, weâ€™ll strengthen the utility of G$ by seeding G$/ETH liquidity, contributing to the G$ treasury, and aligning governance incentives. Our goal is to make UBI culture viral, fundable, and creatively valuable.

âœ… Technical Implementation

Weâ€™ll launch the $IYKYK token & community NFT series via Juicebox. 5â€“10% of raised ETH will be routed to:

G$/ETH liquidity on Uniswap (Base)

Direct G$ treasury contributions

Funds will be held and managed via a Gnosis Safe. Weâ€™ll implement governance boosts for LP stakers in a later phase and track participation via Guild.xyz + Snapshot.

âœ… Team Capability

Our team consists of artists, memers, and DAO-native contributors with experience in:

Juicebox & Snapshot DAO setups

Campaigns on Farcaster, Twitter, Instagram, Substack, Etc

DeFi onboarding + creative bounties
Weâ€™re working closely with the Base ecosystem and aligning with Optimism and Celo through a phased roadmap.

âœ… Roadmap & Milestones

Phase 1 (May - July 2025): Foundation & Community Launch

Launch a community NFT series via Juicebox to kick off IYKYK DAO's funding and onboarding.

Use NFT mint proceeds to fund the initial buy-in of the $IYKYK token and establish treasury liquidity.

Allocate 2â€“5% of all NFT mint revenue to the GoodDollar Treasury to align publicly with public goods.

Begin onboarding campaigns via Discord, Farcaster, and Guild.xyz â€” with roles and missions for contributors and G$ holders.

Publish our public goods mission through the first issue of the IYKYK digital magazine and seed its distribution.

Phase 2 (July - Sept 2025): Liquidity, Governance & Collaboration

Explore and deploy G$ liquidity mechanisms, including:

ETH â†’ G$ liquidity pools on Base

IYKYK â†’ G$ experimental pools for governance-boosting rewards

Launch public goods content bounty program: fund creators to produce G$ and UBI-aligned content for minting via Zora.

Initiate Zora drops tied to magazine themes, memes, and public goods content.

Roll out governance booster features: grant proposal power or voting multipliers to G$/LP holders.

Begin outreach and co-creation with aligned NFT brands, ReFi collectives, and local publication partners.

Weâ€™ll attract users by:

Launching Guild.xyz quests gated by G$ holdings

Distributing $IYKYK to verified G$ claimers (optional allowlist)

Meme campaigns on Farcaster, Twitter, and Warpcast

Collaborations with artists and GoodDollar community members

Strategic partnerships with major NFT brands like Lazy Lions and World of Women

Distribution of our IYKYK digital/print magazine, expanding to the top 5 US cities as part of a national public goods media campaign

All participation will be rewarded with tokens, roles, or bounties.

âœ… Funding Allocation (Grant Usage)

To maximize the impact of the GoodDollar grant, we will strategically deploy the received G$ to deepen liquidity, raise awareness, and support onboarding across both ecosystems:

50% â€” Incentivized Engagement & EducationWe will use this to fund meme campaigns, creative bounties, and quest rewards that introduce new users to both IYKYK and GoodDollar. This includes cross-platform content, Farcaster-native threads, and Guild.xyz quests.

25% â€” G$ Liquidity IncentivesA portion of the grant will be used to seed or match liquidity in G$/ETH or G$/IYKYK pools. This ensures that G$ remains tradable and increasingly useful across onchain markets.

15% â€” G$ Claimant Airdrop & Role AccessWeâ€™ll use part of the G$ grant to airdrop tokens to existing GoodDollar users and grant them access to exclusive roles, tools, and DAO spaces â€” strengthening our shared ecosystem.

10% â€” Operations & Campaign ToolsCovers setup and support infrastructure such as DAO tools, integrations, creative production, and magazine placement related to the campaign.

âœ… Ecosystem Contribution

Contribute meaningful liquidity to the G$ economy through LP seeding and experimental pairings

Incentivize participation in G$ with creative onchain rewards and meme-native experiences

Support the growth of G$ through direct treasury contributions and narrative framing

Enhance the visibility of G$ among creator communities and Web3-native cultural groups

Extend GoodDollarâ€™s reach into both physical and digital spaces via the IYKYK magazine, distributed in top US cities and onchain.

âœ… Ethical Compliance

We affirm our full alignment with the values of the GoodDollar protocol and Gitcoin's eligibility criteria

We are committed to transparency, non-extractive economics, and open governance models

âœ… Additional Info

This grant represents a unique convergence of cultural storytelling, regenerative incentives, and grassroots participation

We aim to position IYKYK as a DAO-native cultural platform that creates real-world and onchain impact

Funding from GoodDollar will not only support these goals but also demonstrate a scalable model for how public goods protocols can collaborate with memecoin DAOs to achieve mutual growth and visibility
