## **1. Project Name**

**IYKYK DAO**

## **2. Tagline**

**From the Blockchain to the Streets: A DAO for Real-World Impact!**

## **3. Project Description**

IYKYK DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to elevating arts and public goods through immersive events, artist development, and community-driven governance. Our 2025 launch strategy combines a free arts, fashion, and entertainment magazine, a pop-up art gallery series, and a tokenized engagement model using the IYK token. The DAO will empower artists and creatives by providing funding opportunities, event exposure, and governance participation, making arts more accessible and sustainable.

## **4. Mission & Vision**

- **Mission:** To elevate the arts as a catalyst for positive change, supporting artists who align with public goods initiatives and funding real-world impact projects.
- **Vision:** A thriving global community where artists can sustainably create, collaborate, and contribute to the social and environmental well-being of their communities—all powered by transparent, decentralized governance.

## **5. The Problem We Aim to Solve**

- **Underfunded Artists & Public Goods:** Artists often struggle to find sustainable funding sources, while public goods (like education, environmental conservation, and community services) also suffer from chronic underfunding.
- **Fragmented Ecosystem:** There is a lack of cohesive platforms that simultaneously develop artistic talent and channel resources into public goods.
- **Lack of Accessible, Transparent Funding:** Traditional grants have bureaucratic limitations, leaving many artists and social initiatives underserved.
- **Lack of Real-World Application for DAOs & Web3:** Many decentralized projects struggle to connect with real communities and demonstrate real-world value beyond digital ecosystems.
- **Need for Shared Community Among Creatives & Audiences:** There is a growing demand for spaces where artists, creatives, and their audiences can engage meaningfully and collaboratively, strengthening cultural and artistic movements.

## **6. Proposed Solution**

IYKYK addresses these challenges by:

1. **Hosting Arts & Culture Events:** Festivals, fashion shows, and exhibitions that generate revenue and community engagement.
2. **Artist Development & Grants:** Providing financial support, mentorship, and residencies to creators who align their work with public goods causes.
3. **Public Goods Funding:** A portion of all event proceeds, sponsorships, and on-chain revenue is allocated to critical social and environmental initiatives.
4. **DAO Governance:** A token-based system enables members to propose and vote on funding allocations, event themes, and strategic direction, ensuring transparency and community ownership.

## **7. Grant Request & Use of Funds**

We are requesting funding to support the foundational development and launch of IYKYK DAO. The funds will be used for:

- **Magazine Production:** Covering design, printing, and distribution costs for the first three issues.
- **DAO Infrastructure:** Smart contract development, governance setup, and operational security.
- **Token Launch:** Development of the IYK token, initial distribution mechanisms, and incentives for early adopters.
- **Pop-Up Art Gallery Series:** Venue rentals, artist stipends, event logistics, and interactive components.
- **Marketing & Community Engagement:** Social media campaigns, partnerships, and onboarding artists and supporters.
- **Technical Development:** Creating a platform for earning, tracking, and utilizing IYK tokens.

## **8. Project Roadmap & Timeline**

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Foundation & Planning** | March - May 2025 | Finalizing legal structure, partnerships, and magazine content. |
| **Pre-Launch & Community Building** | June - August 2025 | DAO infrastructure setup, artist onboarding, and initial marketing campaigns. |
| **Official Launch** | September - November 2025 | Launch of magazine, DAO governance, IYK token, and pop-up art gallery series. |
| **Growth & Expansion** | December 2025 & Beyond | Scaling operations, iterating governance models, and expanding artist support programs. |

## **9. Expected Impact**

- **Artist Empowerment:** Providing artists with funding, exposure, and governance over community initiatives.
- **Public Engagement:** Fostering a stronger arts and culture scene in Denver through interactive, tokenized events.
- **Sustainable Growth:** Establishing a self-sustaining ecosystem where artists and attendees earn and use IYK tokens to shape the community.
- **Web3 Onboarding & Education:** Introducing new users to blockchain technology through real-world applications and interactive learning experiences.
- **Community Building:** Creating a shared cultural space where artists, creatives, and audiences can engage, collaborate, and shape the direction of the arts ecosystem through DAO governance.

## **10. How Gitcoin Funding Will Make a Difference**

By securing funding, we can offer free access to artistic content, incentivize participation, and demonstrate the real-world application of DAOs in supporting creative communities.
