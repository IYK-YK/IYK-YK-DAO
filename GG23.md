**IYKYK** is a decentralized autonomous organization dedicated to harnessing the power of art to support public goods. We will produce high-quality arts events, empower artists with development opportunities and grants, and channel a portion of all proceeds to social and environmental causes. By merging art, community, and decentralized finance, IYKYK aims to become a sustainable engine for creative and civic impact.

### **3. Mission & Vision**

- **Mission:** To elevate the arts as a catalyst for positive change, supporting artists who align with public goods initiatives and funding real-world impact projects.
- **Vision:** A thriving global community where artists can sustainably create, collaborate, and contribute to the social and environmental well-being of their communities—all powered by transparent, decentralized governance.

---

### **4. The Problem We Aim to Solve**

- **Underfunded Artists & Public Goods:** Artists often struggle to find sustainable funding sources, while public goods (like education, environmental conservation, community services) also suffer from chronic underfunding.
- **Fragmented Ecosystem:** There is a lack of cohesive platforms that simultaneously develop artistic talent and channel resources into public goods.
- **Lack of Accessible, Transparent Funding:** Traditional grants have bureaucratic limitations, leaving many artists and social initiatives underserved.

### **5. Proposed Solution**

**IYKYK** addresses these challenges by:

1. **Hosting Arts & Culture Events:** Festivals, fashion shows, and exhibitions that generate revenue and community engagement.
2. **Artist Development & Grants:** Providing financial support, mentorship, and residencies to creators who align their work with public goods causes.
3. **Public Goods Funding:** A portion of all event proceeds, sponsorships, and on-chain revenue is allocated to critical social and environmental initiatives.
4. **DAO Governance:** A token-based system enables members to propose and vote on funding allocations, event themes, and strategic direction, ensuring transparency and community ownership.

### **6. Project Roadmap & Key Milestones**

1. **DAO Formation & Governance Setup (Month 1 – Month 2)**
    - Finalize governance token mechanics and multi-sig wallet structure.
    - Establish transparent voting procedures and community channels (Discord, forums, etc.).
2. **Pilot Artist Grant Fund (Month 2 – Month 3)**
    - Launch an initial round of micro-grants to showcase the DAO’s commitment to supporting emerging artists focused on social impact.
    - Document and share outcomes to attract wider participation.
3. **Residency Program Prototype (Month 3 – Month 5)**
    - Open applications for a small cohort of resident artists committed to public goods themes.
    - Provide resources and mentorship; track progress for community engagement.
4. **First IYKYK Event (Month 4 – Month 6)**
    - Host an inaugural virtual or hybrid festival/fashion show/art exhibit.
    - Showcase DAO-funded artists; use ticket/merch/auction proceeds to bolster the grant fund and partner with at least one recognized public goods nonprofit.
5. **Scaling & Community Growth (Month 6 – Beyond)**
    - Expand artist grants, add more diverse event formats, and onboard strategic partners for broader social impact.

## **Initial Expense Planning**

    - **Multi-Sig Wallet Setup:** Protects community funds and requires multiple signers for transactions.

3. **Branding & Marketing**
    - **Brand Identity and Creative Assets:** Logos, pitch decks, website design.
    - **Initial Marketing Campaign:** To gather a founding community, attract grant applicants, and build hype.
4. **Administrative & Operational Tools**

    - **Accounting & Bookkeeping:** Even basic financial tracking software to manage and report all inflows/outflows transparently.
5. **Community Engagement**
    - **Discord Moderation:** Consider small stipends for core contributors who manage daily community interactions.
    - **Events & Town Halls:** Physical or virtual sessions to onboard members and walk them through the DAO’s processes.
6. **Grant & Residency Program Seed Fund**
    - **Initial Pool for Artists:** Even if you plan to raise more down the line, having a seeded grant pool is crucial to demonstrate immediate impact and legitimacy.
7. **Event Production (if launching early)**
    - **Venue/Platform Deposits:** Depending on your approach (virtual vs. in-person).
    - **Technical Crew/Equipment Rental:** If you do an in-person gathering, you’ll need a basic production team.
8. **Contingency**
