## IYKYK DAO Token Model (Revised for Advanced Readers)

### ðŸ”¹ Overview

The IYKYK DAO token system is designed to integrate decentralized governance, cultural funding, and meaningful community engagement. It operates through a two-layer architecture:

1. **IYK Token (ERC-20, powered by Juicebox)** â€“ This serves as the primary economic unit and governance mechanism. It enables users to participate in funding decisions, governance processes, and reward systems.
2. **Membership NFTs (Nouns-style architecture)** â€“ These NFTs function as governance primitives, granting holders high-level control over the DAO. This includes authority over treasury strategy, Juicebox settings, and protocol evolution.

### ðŸ”¸ IYK Token: Core Functions and Economics

#### 1. Minting Process

* IYK tokens are minted when contributors deposit ETH into the Juicebox contract.
* The system launches with a fixed mint rate. Over time, this will evolve into a bonding curve model to reflect demand-based pricing.
* Each funding cycle allocates a percentage of newly minted IYK as a reserved pool for NFT holders.

#### 2. Earning and Distribution Mechanisms

* IYK is distributed as a reward for consumer participation in:

  * Event sign-ins
  * QR code activations
  * App downloads
  * Campaign missions and artist-led engagements
* Artists and sponsors can create custom campaignsâ€”such as scavenger huntsâ€”to distribute IYK tokens in innovative ways.

#### 3. Redemption and Deflation

* IYK tokens can be redeemed for:

  * Tickets to events
  * Exclusive merchandise
  * Travel and hospitality experiences
* Redeemed tokens are permanently burned, helping maintain supply equilibrium and minimize inflation.

### ðŸ”¸ IYK Token in Governance

#### 1. Voting Power and Staking

* IYK token holders vote on:

  * Allocations from the IYKYK Grant Treasury
  * Flows.wtf grant stream configurations
  * Prioritization of funding categories and community missions
* Voting rights are activated through staking, creating alignment and accountability among participants.

#### 2. Burn-Driven Voting Cycles

* Certain grant votes, especially high-impact ones, require burning tokens to cast votes. This disincentivizes spam voting and encourages long-term participation.

#### 3. Identity Verification

* Sybil resistance is implemented through integrations with:

  * Proof of Humanity
  * BrightID
  * Gitcoin Passport

These identity systems help ensure equitable governance by limiting duplicate accounts.

### ðŸ”¸ Membership NFTs: Governance and Benefits

#### 1. Launch Mechanism

* NFTs are distributed via a Nouns-style auction system.
* Holders receive:

  * Unique generative artwork
  * Full governance rights across DAO operations

#### 2. Powers of Governance

NFT holders influence key aspects of the protocol, including:

* Allocation parameters in Juicebox (e.g., mint rate, reserve ratio)
* Flows-based funding stream creation and management
* Grant approval structures
* Treasury management strategies and emergency procedures

#### 3. Reserved Token Allocation

* A portion of each funding cycleâ€™s minted tokens (initially 25%) is reserved for NFT holders.
* These reserved tokens are claimable quarterly.
* The exact quantity is dynamically adjusted according to DAO revenue and Juicebox cycle performance, ensuring alignment between participation and incentives.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Treasury Architecture and Capital Allocation

Funds raised in each Juicebox cycle are automatically split:

* **50% â†’ IYKYK DAO Treasury**

  * Supports operational and promotional activities tied to sponsorships and community programs
* **30% â†’ Operations (via Gnosis Safe multisig)**

  * Funds staffing, marketing, tooling, and events
* **20% â†’ IYKYK Grant Treasury**

  * Fuels the Flows.wtf system and community-initiated art/public goods projects

---

### ðŸ”¸ Token Supply Lifecycle

* Token supply is demand-driven, expanding via ETH contributions.
* Supply is curtailed through the burn mechanism when users redeem tokens.
* DAO governance maintains the authority to adjust mint rates and reintroduce burned tokens if strategically necessary.

### ðŸ”¸ Roadmap for Token Development

| Phase | Milestone          | Features                                           |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Launch             | Fixed-rate minting and NFT governance launch       |
| 2     | Ecosystem Growth   | Seasonal quests and artist-led activations         |
| 3     | Dynamic Minting    | Transition to a bonding curve via Juicebox upgrade |
| 4     | Treasury Expansion | Formalization of treasury governance and audits    |

### ðŸ”¸ Artist and Sponsor Toolkits

* Customizable toolkits empower creators and sponsors to:

  * Launch QR-based engagement quests
  * Propose mint events via the Nouns Buildr interface
  * Include embedded IYK airdrops with their NFT activations

---

### ðŸ”¸ Transparency and Reporting

The DAO maintains a quarterly reporting system including:

* Token issuance and burn logs
* Detailed breakdowns of treasury activity
* Performance analysis of funded grant streams
* Governance participation and proposals passed

---

### ðŸ”¸ Security and Risk Management

* Juicebox parameter changes and fund distributions are gated by:

  * On-chain governance with DAO oversight
  * Multisig emergency systems
  * Scheduled audits and bug bounty support

These mechanisms ensure DAO resilience against manipulation and unauthorized access.
