**IYKYK** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that believes in the transformative power of the arts.

1. **Produce High-Quality Arts Events** – Festivals, fashion shows, exhibitions, and performances that captivate and inspire.
2. **Empower Artists** – Through development programs, mentorship, and funding opportunities.
3. **Support Public Goods** – Raise awareness, funds, and collective momentum for social and environmental causes.

    ## Why the Arts & Public Goods?
    
    Creative expression and public good initiatives might seem like two different worlds, but we see them as interconnected forces. When art is elevated, communities thrive culturally and economically. At the same time, public goods—like education, sustainability projects, and civic infrastructure—depend on strong communal support. By uniting these two spheres, IYKYK uses art as a driver for broader societal benefit.

    ## Our Pillars
    
    ### 1. Cultural Production & Events
    
    - **Curated Experiences:** From immersive festivals to avant-garde fashion shows and community art exhibits, we produce events that spotlight diverse artistic voices.
    - **Purpose-Driven Programming:** Each event is an opportunity to raise funds and awareness for public goods initiatives, weaving social or environmental causes into the creative experience.
    
    ### 2. Artist Development & Support
    
    - **Grant Fund:** We govern an on-chain grant program that offers financial resources to emerging and established artists committed to making a social impact.
    - **Mentorship & Workshops:** Through training sessions, panels, and peer-to-peer mentorship, artists receive the tools to grow their craft and build sustainable careers.
    - **Artist Residency Program:** We offer residencies to creators whose projects align with a public goods cause. Selected artists receive dedicated workspace, resources, and guidance to bring socially relevant works to life.
    
    ### 3. Public Goods & Community Impact
    
    - **Funding Mechanisms:** A portion of event proceeds, NFT sales, sponsorships, and donations funnels directly into community initiatives and nonprofit partnerships.
    - **Celebrations & Recognitions:** We regularly highlight individuals, collectives, and organizations making significant contributions to the arts and society at large, fostering a culture of gratitude and inspiration.
    - **Collaborative Partnerships:** IYKYK forges alliances with civic organizations, charities, and local governments to maximize the reach and impact of our efforts.

    ## Governance & Community
    
    IYKYK is designed to be **transparent**, **equitable**, and **community-led**:
    
    - **DAO Membership & Voting:** Community members hold governance tokens (or equivalent rights) that allow them to propose and vote on initiatives—ranging from which artists receive grants to the causes and communities we prioritize for funding.
    - **On-Chain Transparency:** All transactions and allocations—from grant payouts to event budgets—are tracked and reported on a public ledger, promoting trust and accountability.
