# Treasury Management Plan #

## **Overview**

The IYKYK DAO Treasury is structured to ensure **long-term sustainability, stable funding for artist grants, and strategic asset management**. By **staking a majority of the treasuryâ€™s assets to generate yield**, alongside diversified revenue streams, we create a **self-sustaining grant system** without relying on token inflation or unsustainable token sales.

## **1. Core Treasury Strategy**

The treasury will be managed using a **hybrid funding model**, combining **staking yields, direct sponsorships, and IYK ecosystem revenues**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Staked Treasury Yield as the Primary Funding Source**

- The **majority of the treasury is staked** in **yield-bearing assets** to generate a **sustainable funding pool** for artist grants.
- **Example Projection**: If the treasury holds **$500,000 in assets** earning an **average 5% APY**, it generates **$25,000 annually** for artist grants without needing to sell tokens.
- **Diversification of Yield Sources:**
    - **Stablecoin staking** (USDC, DAI in Aave/Compound).
    - **Liquid staking (stETH, rETH, or LST protocols).**
    - **Real-world asset-backed yield (tokenized bonds, RWAs).**
    - **A portion of yield revenue is reinvested into the treasury** to ensure long-term fund expansion.

### **ðŸ”¹ Additional Revenue Streams to Grow Treasury**

- **Sponsorship Payments in IYK**: Brands pay for **event sponsorships, ad slots, and community activations** in IYK or stablecoins, which are cycled into treasury growth.
- **IYK Minting Revenue**: Users purchasing IYK (for voting and participation) provide **ongoing treasury inflow in USDC/ETH**.
- **NFT & Collectible Sales**: Limited edition artist NFTs, event passes, or collectibles provide an **alternative revenue source**.
- **Direct Donations & DAO Partnerships**: Philanthropic organizations and Web3 DAOs can contribute to **funding artistic public goods**.

## **2. Treasury Asset Allocation Plan**

To maintain **risk-balanced growth**, the treasury will be **divided across different investment categories** and rebalanced quarterly based on DAO governance votes.

| **Asset Type** | **Allocation %** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stablecoins (USDC, DAI)** | 40% | Provides stable yield and liquidity for artist grants. A minimum of 20% remains liquid for immediate disbursements. |
| **Liquid Staking (stETH, rETH, LSTs)** | 30% | Earns staking yield while remaining liquid. |
| **Real-World Asset Tokens (RWAs)** | 15% | Tokenized government bonds, yield-bearing treasuries. |
| **IYK Reserves & Treasury Funds** | 10% | Used for IYK buybacks, ecosystem stability. |
| **Strategic DAO Partnerships** | 5% | Invested in cultural & Web3 partnerships. |

### **ðŸ”¹ Treasury Emergency Buffer**

- A portion of stablecoins is **held in reserve** to cover grant shortfalls in case of **market downturns or unexpected costs**.
- **Sponsorship revenue is partially allocated to an emergency grant fund** to ensure funding continuity even if APY fluctuates.
- DAO governance can **adjust the buffer threshold** depending on market conditions.

## **3. Funding Artist Grants: Dynamic Allocation Model**

Rather than committing to **fixed grant amounts**, IYKYK DAO will use a **dynamic funding system** where grant budgets **scale based on treasury performance**.

### **ðŸ”¹ APY-Linked Grant Fund Distribution**

- **Grants are adjusted based on treasury yield performance**.
- Example:
    - If **APY remains at 5%**, **grants remain at $25,000 per year**.
    - If yield **drops to 3%**, grants are **scaled down** to prevent treasury drain.
    - If yield **increases to 7%**, grant funds **increase proportionally**.
- A **reinvestment ratio** ensures a portion of yield **goes back into the treasury** to sustain future grants.

## **4. IYK Staking for Grant Influence & Treasury Yield Rewards**

- Users can **stake IYK** in a treasury vault to **earn a share of the DAOâ€™s treasury yield**.
- Stakers receive **influence multipliers** in grant voting rounds, aligning incentives between treasury growth and voting power.
- **Staking Lockup Options:** Users choose between **flexible staking (lower rewards)** and **long-term staking (higher rewards with penalties for early withdrawal)**.
- **Burn Rebate Incentive:** Stakers receive a **burn rebate**, reducing the token burn cost when redeeming rewards, encouraging long-term staking while keeping circulation active.
- **Quadratic Voting Protection:** Ensures **small stakers still have meaningful voting impact**, preventing whale dominance.
- **Treasury Rebalancing Governance:** The DAO can **adjust staking yield allocation** based on **market conditions** to optimize fund sustainability.

## **5. Treasury Governance & Security**

### **ðŸ”¹ DAO-Controlled Allocation Adjustments**

- YK holders **vote on treasury allocation changes** and **funding priorities**.
- A **supermajority threshold** is required to **adjust yield strategies** or **withdraw emergency funds**.
- **Quarterly rebalancing votes** allow DAO members to **shift asset allocations** based on market performance.

### **ðŸ”¹ Risk Mitigation & Security**

- **Multi-sig treasury management** to prevent unauthorized fund access.
- **Regular audits and yield performance reviews** to optimize treasury strategy.
- **Stable diversification strategy** to prevent **overexposure to volatile assets**.

## **6. Final Summary: Why This Model Works**

âœ… **Sustainable Grants** â€“ Yield covers funding needs **without draining the treasury**.
âœ… **Treasury Growth Model** â€“ Additional revenue streams **expand the grant pool over time**.
âœ… **Long-Term Treasury Stability** â€“ Balanced asset allocation ensures **funding remains predictable**.
âœ… **Governance Control** â€“ DAO **maintains full control** over yield allocations and emergency reserves.
âœ… **Liquidity Reserve Maintained** â€“ At least **20% of stablecoin funds remain liquid** to ensure **immediate grant access**.

## **Next Steps**

- **Deploy initial staking strategies** for stable yield.
- **Activate sponsorship programs** to onboard treasury inflows.
- **Test APY-linked grant model** with an initial round of artist funding.
- **Implement quarterly treasury rebalancing governance** to fine-tune allocations.

By **optimizing the treasury strategy**, IYKYK DAO ensures **self-sustaining funding for artists and creative projects**, aligning incentives between governance, community, and treasury growth.
