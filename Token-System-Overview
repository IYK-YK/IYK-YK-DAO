# IYKYK Token Minting and Distribution System

## Overview

The IYKYK DAO introduces a comprehensive token minting and distribution system leveraging Juicebox DAO, designed to transparently manage fundraising, sponsorship opportunities, consumer engagement incentives, and tokenomics through the IYK token. Initially launching with a fixed mint rate, the system will transition into a bonding curve model for dynamic and market-responsive token pricing.

## DAO Membership and Nouns NFT Governance

Membership within the IYKYK DAO is represented through ownership of specialized Nouns-style NFTs. These NFTs provide holders with exclusive governance rights and privileges within the DAO. Members actively participate in the governance process, deciding on critical issues such as treasury allocations, strategic initiatives, parameter adjustments, and overall DAO direction.

The Nouns NFTs enable a clear and decentralized governance structure, ensuring each member has an equitable voice and stake in the DAO’s success. NFT holders also gain eligibility for special reserved token claims, creating additional alignment between the DAO’s financial performance and member incentives.

## Initial Token Minting via Juicebox (Fixed Rate)

Initially, the IYK tokens are minted through quarterly Juicebox fundraising cycles, each lasting approximately 90 days, using a fixed mint rate. Juicebox provides a transparent, decentralized mechanism for sponsors and community members to purchase tokens, ensuring clarity, ease of use, and predictable treasury growth.

## Transition to Bonding Curve

Following initial market validation and community education, the DAO will introduce a bonding curve mechanism for minting tokens. This bonding curve will dynamically adjust the token minting price based on supply and demand, creating market-responsive pricing:

* **Linear Bonding Curve:** A transparent and simple formula will incrementally adjust token prices based on total circulating supply.
* **Governance Adjustments:** DAO governance can periodically review and adjust bonding curve parameters (base price, slope) to maintain economic stability.

## Allocation of Raised Funds

Funds raised from each Juicebox cycle are automatically split and allocated to three distinct purposes, promoting long-term sustainability, efficient operational management, and impactful community contributions:

1. **IYKYK DAO Treasury (50%)**
   Allocated directly to the IYKYK DAO Treasury, supporting sponsorship and advertising opportunities redeemable exclusively with IYK tokens.

2. **Operational Costs via Gnosis Safe (30%)**
   Allocated to a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet for operational expenses, including overhead, administrative, technological infrastructure, staffing, marketing, and community activities.

3. **IYKYK Grant Treasury (20%)**
   Allocated to the IYKYK Grant Treasury, funding community-driven projects, innovation, artists, developers, and ecosystem vitality.

## Token Utility

The IYK token serves as the primary medium of exchange within the DAO ecosystem. Sponsors purchase tokens to redeem for advertising slots and engage with the community through promotional activities. Consumers earn tokens by participating in engagement activities such as booth sign-ins, QR scans, app downloads, or volunteer hours.

## Token Redemption and Burn

Consumers redeem their earned tokens for tangible rewards, including event tickets, vacation stays, or merchandise. Tokens redeemed for rewards are permanently burnt, effectively managing token inflation and maintaining balanced token economics.

## Consumer Voting and Grant Treasury Governance

Consumers have the ability to save IYK tokens and utilize them for voting on the distribution of funds from the IYKYK Grant Treasury. Regular voting cycles allow consumers to participate in governance without token burning, empowering active involvement in community decision-making. Additionally, special grant cycles may be implemented periodically, incentivizing token burning to encourage active consumer participation and engagement while simultaneously helping manage token supply.

## Reserved Token Claims (NFT-Gated)

Initially, 25% of newly minted IYK tokens are reserved each funding cycle for holders of the DAO's membership NFTs. NFT holders claim these reserved tokens quarterly, proportionally based on the DAO’s revenue and performance metrics, aligning incentives directly with DAO success.

## Governance and Parameter Management

The DAO maintains comprehensive on-chain governance, enabling members to propose and vote on critical parameters such as minting ratios, ETH allocation splits, reserved token proportions, token burn rates, and bonding curve adjustments. This adaptive governance ensures agile and strategic responsiveness to market conditions.

## Transparency, Reporting, and Accountability

The DAO commits to full transparency, providing detailed quarterly financial and performance reports. Real-time treasury balances, funding cycle updates, ETH allocations, and reserved token claims are accessible via public dashboards, fostering trust and accountability.

## Security and Risk Management

Security is a top priority, with ongoing comprehensive security audits, active bug bounty programs, and emergency multisig mechanisms to ensure resilience against vulnerabilities or exploits.
