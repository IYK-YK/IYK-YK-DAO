## Overview

IYKYK is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to leveraging the power of art to support public goods and societal causes. Through curated events, an artist development program, and a transparent grant funding mechanism, IYKYK fosters a community that marries creative expression with tangible social impact.

### Mission

- **Elevate the Arts**: Produce high-quality arts events like festivals, fashion shows, exhibits, and showcases.
- **Empower Artists**: Provide grants, residencies, and mentorship to artists who commit to public goods initiatives.
- **Support Public Goods**: Channel funds and awareness toward social and environmental causes that benefit communities.

## Rationale

Art is often seen as a mirror to society, reflecting cultural trends and sparking conversations. Meanwhile, public goods—from local community projects to environmental conservation—constantly face funding and awareness challenges. By uniting these two domains, IYKYK ensures that creative endeavors don’t just entertain; they also drive real-world, positive change.

## Key Components

### 1. DAO Governance

- **Token-Based Voting**: Members hold governance tokens, empowering them to propose and vote on initiatives, including the selection of grant recipients and allocation of the treasury.
- **Transparent Treasury**: All transactions, from event proceeds to grant disbursements, are recorded on-chain, fostering trust and community involvement.
- **Decentralized Participation**: Individuals from diverse backgrounds—artists, art patrons, collectors, philanthropists—can join, contributing skills and resources.

### 2. Events & Cultural Production

- **High-Profile Festivals & Shows**: Showcasing diverse artistic talent in unique settings.
- **Collaborations with Nonprofits**: Hosting charity auctions, panel discussions, and collaborative performances that focus on relevant public goods topics.
- **Digital & Physical Synergy**: Incorporating NFT exhibitions, virtual galleries, and live streaming to broaden global reach.

### 3. Artist Development & Support

- **Grant Program**: Periodic rounds where artists submit proposals for projects that intersect creativity with a social or environmental cause.
- **Residencies**: Physical or virtual residencies offering mentors, resources, and networking opportunities.
- **Mentorship & Workshops**: Sessions led by established artists, nonprofit leaders, and industry experts to cultivate professional growth.

### 4. Public Goods & Community Impact

- **Targeted Funding**: A portion of all DAO revenue (event tickets, sponsorships, NFT sales) is allocated to social and environmental projects vetted by the community.
- **Collaborative Partnerships**: Alliances with organizations, NGOs, and government bodies to scale impact.
- **Recognition & Awards**: Annual showcases and spotlights on outstanding contributors to the arts and public goods.
