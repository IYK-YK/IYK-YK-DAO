### üß†¬†Concept Overview 
"Slices & Scavenger Hunt"

A GPS + IYK sticker-based scavenger hunt & CCO Art Cometition Global Pizza Day , May 22nd 2025, to promote the Lil Nouns iconic characters & governance-driven community.
A growing number of business owners and arts collectives in Denver are actively searching for opportunities to explore crypto applications , from governance , to point of sale. We hope this event can serve as a jumping off point for the rest of 2025 during which we aim to bring local organizational sponsors, and web3 communities together in Colorado for the first time. 
Each stop will feature a POAP, a slice of culture, and a touch of web3.

Scavenger Hunt - May 20th - 22nd
Art Competition - Submission Due Date May 19th.

Shout out to gramajo.eth for prop 293 which inspired this prop. I have been looking for a good strategy to kick of an engaged lil nouns community  
in Denver Colorado and a scavenger hunt is just the right level of interesting. Should the prop pass we are confident in our ability to organize on a 
short timetable and have already identified lead organizers and commisioned artists.

We are the core organizers of a budding artist collective based in Denver Colorado with a mission to elevate arts and public goods through the innovative
and equitable application of technology! We work with local businesses, non-profits, and creatives to produce high quality culltural events that elevate, 
educate, and equitize. We work to educate our audiences on the power that NFTs and Blockchain have to improve their lives, and their communities. Our summer pop up 
series features artists graduated from our homebrew Web3 Artist Development Curriculum, and each of them implements NFTs into their work in some way. This will make a really 
way to kickstart the summer and get as many eyes on us as possible before our Pop Up Series Begins this June, ensuring that Denverites have plenty of opportunities to learn about 
Nouns, Lil Nouns, and the magic of web3.

## üí∞¬†Budget Proposal
We worked to keep a similar budget to the recently approved scavenger hunt in NYC but have customized it to meet our stated goals, 
as they differ from prop 293. We can save a bit on artist commissions , but we want to make a big push to introduce new audiences to Lil Nouns, 
so we have opted to include an ask for a small social media budget in order to run a few targeted paid ad campaigns. This combined with our Social Media Short 
Competition should help generate a substantial amount of engagement both on and offline. Some of the materials costs are estimates and we have no way of knowing 
how many people will complete the scavenger hunt so we want to have enough prize money to be safe. Any unused funds will be promptly returned to the Lil Nouns treasury.

|  Item   |      Cost       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 10 POAP Commissions    |   $1,000     |
| Prize Pool (ETH / USD + Burnr)   | $1,250   |
| Deployment Support |  $250  |
| IYK NFC Stickers + Shirts |  $300  |
| Content & Marketing |  $200  |
| Mobile Map/Site |  Free  |
|  Total  |  $3,000 / ~2 ETH  |
Additionally, we request 2 Lil Nouns from the treasury to award the top two winners.


## ü§≥ Content + Promo Strategy
- Countdown teasers on social
- Partner promo with Pizza DAO 
- Social Media Shorts at POAP sites.
- Daily prize reveals & location hints.
- Artful selfie challenges at each sticker site.



## üîó¬†Bonus Integration Ideas
- FOOD Token for redeeming with local sponsors.
- IRL collabs with local artists/vendors for sticker visuals.



## üìç¬†Next Steps
1. Finalize 10 location partners
2. Commission POAP artists (aim for 1 Lil Nouns-connected artist)
3. Coordinate with IYK on sticker logistics
4. Launch scavenger map site (via Notion or no-code)
5. Kick off promo campaign 2‚Äì3 weeks ahead of May 22
