## A Moment of Transition
City Nouns has always been an ambitious experiment â€” one that many of us in this Cohort joined with enthusiasm and hope. As early contributors, we helped shape the launch, supported governance, and brought energy and resources to the project. Over time, however, itâ€™s become clear that some of us envision a different path forward than the current direction.

Rather than remain in tension or disengage quietly, weâ€™re proposing a thoughtful, principled exit. This isnâ€™t about opposition â€” itâ€™s about making space. Space for those continuing the mission to move forward with clarity, and space for us to step away with dignity, fairness, and respect.

## Why This Exit Strengthens the DAO
Weâ€™ve designed this proposal to be constructive, clean, and aligned with City Nounsâ€™ long-term values:

Flat Exit Price of 0.033 ETH: Averages historical token sales while recognizing early risk and effort.
Token Burn Commitment: All reacquired tokens will be publicly burned (0x000...dEaD), preserving decentralization and reducing governance consolidation.
No Ongoing Claims: We exit fully and formally â€” no future claims, no entanglements.

By honoring this request, the DAO gains a more focused contributor base and reinforces a culture of fair exits and clear transitions.
