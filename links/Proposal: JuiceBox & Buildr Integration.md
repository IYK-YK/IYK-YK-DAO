## Proposal: Direct Integration of Juicebox Contract Control with Nouns Builder Governor Contract

### Objective

Enable direct governance control of Juicebox fundraising and token minting contracts through the existing Governor contract deployed by Builder DAO (Nouns.build). This integration aims to streamline governance processes, enhance security, and foster transparency. Additionally, this tool should be designed for flexible adoption by other DAOs utilizing Nouns Builder.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Governor Contract Integration**

   * Assign ownership of Juicebox DAO fundraising and token minting contracts directly to the Governor contract used by the Nouns Builder DAO.
   * Allow the Governor contract to directly execute parameter adjustments within Juicebox, including mint rates, funding cycle configurations, reserved token allocations, and ETH splits.

2. **Flexible Administrative Privileges**

   * Enable customizable administrative permissions during DAO setup.
   * Allow selective delegation of specific operational tasks (e.g., executing payment cycles) to multisig wallets, without granting authority to modify critical minting parameters.

3. **Token and Treasury Management Alignment**

   * Align Juicebox fundraising cycles and token minting rules with governance cycles managed by the Nouns Builder Governor.
   * Facilitate automatic updates to Juicebox cycles and treasury allocations based on governance decisions.

### Benefits

* **Decentralized Decision-Making:** Promotes community transparency and direct participation through on-chain governance.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Consolidates governance processes, simplifying management and reducing redundant proposals.
* **Customizable Security and Accountability:** Offers tailored security measures by allowing nuanced delegation of responsibilities to multisig wallets and clearly defined permissions.

### Implementation Steps

* Collaborate with Builder DAO developers to evaluate Governor contract capabilities.
* Develop necessary adapter contracts or middleware to enable seamless integration between Juicebox and the Governor contract.
* Test thoroughly in testnet environments prior to mainnet deployment.

### Next Steps

* Submit this proposal to the community for feedback and refinement.
* Formalize technical documentation and coordinate integration efforts with Builder DAO and Juicebox development teams.
