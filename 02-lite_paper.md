# IYKYK DAO Lite Paper (Updated and Expanded)

## Overview

IYKYK is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that unites art and social impact by leveraging creativity to support public goods and societal causes. Through curated cultural events, robust artist development programs, transparent governance, and impactful grant mechanisms, IYKYK nurtures a thriving community committed to meaningful change.

## Mission

* **Elevate the Arts**: Curate high-caliber events including festivals, fashion shows, art exhibitions, and diverse creative showcases.
* **Empower Artists**: Offer artists funding, residencies, mentorship, and opportunities for meaningful professional development aligned with public good.
* **Support Public Goods**: Mobilize funds, awareness, and partnerships for environmental, social, and community initiatives benefiting broader society.

## Rationale

Art reflects societal values and ignites critical conversations, while public goods initiatives frequently struggle with limited funding and attention. By integrating these sectors, IYKYK ensures creative expressions not only inspire but catalyze tangible societal benefits.

## Key Components

### 1. DAO Governance

* **Token-Based Voting**: Governance tokens enable members to propose and democratically vote on strategic decisions, grant allocations, and treasury usage.
* **Transparent Treasury**: All financial activities, including revenue from events and grants disbursed, are securely recorded on-chain.
* **Inclusive Membership**: Open participation encourages contributions from artists, patrons, collectors, philanthropists, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.

### 2. Events & Cultural Production

* **Curated Festivals & Exhibitions**: Showcasing diverse talents in innovative, high-profile events.
* **Collaborative Nonprofit Initiatives**: Joint ventures including charity auctions, panel discussions, and performances focused on public goods themes.
* **Hybrid Experiences**: Integrating physical and digital formats, such as NFT art exhibits, virtual galleries, and live-streamed global events.

### 3. Artist Development & Support

* **Grant Programs**: Regular submission cycles where artists propose projects intersecting creativity and societal impact.
* **Residency Programs**: Offering selected artists dedicated resources, mentorship, and network-building opportunities in both physical and virtual spaces.
* **Mentorship & Workshops**: Professional development sessions led by industry experts, established artists, and nonprofit leaders.

### 4. Public Goods & Community Impact

* **Community-Directed Funding**: Allocating revenue portions from events, sponsorships, and NFT sales to vetted social and environmental initiatives.
* **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborating with NGOs, governments, and community organizations to amplify social impact.
* **Recognition & Awards**: Celebrating outstanding contributions to the intersection of arts and public goods through annual awards and showcases.

Nouns DAO-level proposals will govern the establishment of new funding flows, adjustments to funding distributions, and proposals for larger initiatives such as infrastructure improvements and educational program funding.

## Community & Culture

* **Inclusivity**: Commitment to diversity in art forms, participation, and impact initiatives.
* **Transparency & Accountability**: Robust governance practices, open communication channels, and regular community updates.
